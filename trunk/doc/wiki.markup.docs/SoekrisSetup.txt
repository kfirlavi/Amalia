This link have a very good tutorial for the soekris box: http://www.ultradesic.com/index.php?section=22
== Connecting ==

 1. Install minicom:
{{{
aptitude install minicom
}}}
 There is a nice tutorial on minicom [http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/connect-soekris-single-board-computer-using-minicom.html here].
 1. Connect the serial port of your computer to the Soekris
 1. run {{{minicom}}}
  1. CTRL-A O 
  1. Choose "Serial port setup"
  1. "Serial Device" should be {{{/dev/ttyS0}}} and "Bps/Par/Bits" should be {{{38400 8N1}}}
  1. Choose "Save setup as dfl" end exit the menu
  1. Now you can reset Soekris and you will see the comp load inside the minicom terminal. 

== Setting PXE Boot ==
We want the clients to boot from the network using PXE.[[BR]]
So, we will enable it in the Soekris bios. 
 1. Reset the Soekris box
 1. Press CTRL-p when it shows to. 
 1. Type 
{{{
set BootDrive=F0
set PXEBoot=Enabled
set ConSpeed=38400
}}}
 1. Type {{{show}}} to see the changes.
 1. Reset and you will see the MAC and the box boot from PXE. 
 1. As you can read in bug #17, you will need to replace the file {{{/var/lib/tftpboot/ltsp/i386/pxelinux.0}}} with this attachment:pxelinux.0 in the tftp server. Read this bug, and the page linked to it.
