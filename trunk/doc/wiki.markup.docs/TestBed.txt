== Working as a regular user ==
 1. Change the ownership of your personal files:
{{{
chown -R kfir:kfir /home/kfir
}}}
 1. Create an ssh key
{{{
ssh-keygen -b 4048 -t rsa
}}}
 1. Copy your public key to the nfs root of testbed machines (as root):
{{{
cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub >>  /opt/ltsp/i386/root/.ssh/authorized_keys
}}}
 1. Need to take care of apache2 configuration:
  1. Edit the file {{{/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default}}}:
{{{
RewriteEngine On
RewriteOptions Inherit
RewriteRule ^/~([a-z][a-z0-9]+)/(.+)\.(probe|iperf|dump)(|\.gz) /~$1/testbed/cgi-bin/dispatch.sh/~$1/$2\.$3$4 [NS,T=application/x    -http-cgi]
}}}
  This is the engine to enable per user cgi-bin and dynamic mime-type.
  1. Add the line to {{{/etc/apache2/mods-available/userdir.conf}}}:
{{{
<Directory /home/*/testbed/cgi-bin>
       Options ExecCGI                                                                                                          
       SetHandler cgi-script
</Directory>
}}}
  This will set the cgi-bin dir as executable by apache. Note that {{{/home/*}}} is the users public_html folder. 
 1. Edit sudoers with
{{{
visudo
}}}
 and add this line for each user
{{{
kfir    ALL= /home/kfir/testbed/bin/cpkrn2tftpdir
}}}
 This will let user kfir to run {{{cpkrn2tftpdir}}} as root.

== Testbed scripts ==
=== checkout your version of testbed scripts ===
 1. login to scriptng with your user. 
 1. Checkout the scripts to bin directory: 
{{{
svn checkout http://sauron/svn-repos/testbed/trunk/testbed
}}}
 1. logout and login again so {{{.bashrc}}} will add {{{~/bin}}} directory to your path. 
 1. now running scripts will search at your bin dir and then the global one. (just run {{{echo $PATH}}} to see the sequence of the search).

=== Committing a change ===
{{{
svn commit -m "brief explenation what is this change" [file1 file2 ...]
}}}
leaving the file field empty will commit all the changes in all files. 

=== Checking things out === 
{{{
svn info
}}}
{{{
svn status
}}}
{{{
svn diff [file]
}}}

=== Getting the latest changes of files ===
To get the latest changes in the repository:
{{{
svn update

This should be done daily, to not drift from the main repository.
