This work was done as part of my MS.c researching congestion control algorithms at the Hamilton Institute at the National University of Ireland.

This project was based on the work of:
Prof. Douglas Leith
Baruch Even
Stephen Hemminger
Gavin McCullagh

Which led to the initial commits of the repository. 

Next is a dear friend Ian Dangerfield, which contributed to the madwifi patches, and mentored me in my research.

And the last but not least is David Malone that was helping with all his heart and endless knowledge, to develop the hardest parts of the code ;) tnx
